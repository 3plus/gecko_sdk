  The Multi Channel command class is used to address one or more endpoints in a Multi Channel
  device.

  This component provides functionality for supporting devices with multiple endpoints that can be
  controlled directly by the Multi Channel Command Class. One device can have multiple unique
  endpoints, but the Root device itself can be addressed as well.
