label: ECDHE-Based Key Exchange
description: >-
  This component provides support for key exchange mechanisms in Mbed TLS'
  TLS implementation based on ephemeral ECDH keys. It will turn on all ECDHE key
  exchange methods available with the currently configured components.
  If a smaller selection of key exchange mechanisms is preferable, then please
  do not enable this component, but rather set the relevant
  'SL_MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_xxx' configuration options manually.
